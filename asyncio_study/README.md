# Asyncio

> This module provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines,
multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources,
running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html

> asyncio_study is the new concurrency module introduced in Python 3.4. Itâ€™s designed to use coroutines and futures to simplify asynchronous code and make it almost as readable as synchronous code simply because there are no callbacks.

> Async - A style of concurrent programming in which tasks release the CPU during waiting periods,
so that other tasks can use it.

# 0. Coroutines / Generators
Fundamental idea behind Asyncio.

## Coroutines

# 0.5 Thread
Understanding of threads is required to grasp what an event loop is.

> Think of a thread as a single sequence of instructions and the CPU's current state in executing them (CPU state refers to e.g. register values, in particular the next instruction register).

- Results At End
    - run an independent function multiple times
    - order doesn't matter
    - can be run simultaneously
    - "pure" functions are the best
    - you can wait till all the calls complete before looking at the results
- Results as we go
