# Asyncio-Study

This is a repository for all my code snippets and study material in asyncio and its related web client libraries(aiohttp, sanic).

I wanted to gather all the good material that I read about these material from
books, blog posts, youtube videos and such to get a better understanding of what asyncio is and how it can be used.

# Asyncio Key Concepts

0. Coroutines / Generators
1. Event Loop
2. Futures
3. Tasks


# 0. Coroutines / Generators
Fundamental idea behind Asyncio.

## Coroutines
https://github.com/suhjohn/Asyncio-Study/tree/master/coroutines-generators/coroutines

# 0.5 Thread
Understanding of threads is required to grasp what an event loop is.

> Think of a thread as a single sequence of instructions and the CPU's current state in executing them (CPU state refers to e.g. register values, in particular the next instruction register).
