# Asyncio-Study

This is a repository for all my code snippets and study material in asyncio and its related web client libraries(aiohttp, sanic).

I wanted to gather all the good material that I read about these material from
books, blog posts, youtube videos and such to get a better understanding of what asyncio is and how it can be used.

# 0. Coroutines / Generators
Fundamental idea behind Asyncio.

## Coroutines

> A coroutine is a function that can "return" while still remembering the state in which it is returning (value of local variables, and what the next instruction should be). This will then allow the coroutine to be called again, which results in it continuing from where it left off.

# 0.5 Thread
Understanding of threads is required to grasp what an event loop is.

> Think of a thread as a single sequence of instructions and the CPU's current state in executing them (CPU state refers to e.g. register values, in particular the next instruction register).
