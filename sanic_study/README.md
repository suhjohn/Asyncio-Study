# Sanic

> Sanic is a Flask-like Python 3.5+ web server that’s written to go fast. It’s based on the work done by the amazing folks at magicstack, and was inspired by this article.
On top of being Flask-like, Sanic supports async request handlers.
This means you can use the new shiny async/await syntax from Python 3.5, making your code non-blocking and speedy.<p/>
